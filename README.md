# AES2012
this project is my homework of \<\<theoretical cryptology\>\> course.
this is a project about AES encryption & decryption realization in C, and it apply CBC mode to ensure it can achieve CPA security.
The IDE used is visual studio 2012, you can open the project directly in this IDE without any problem.  Or you can create a project
by yourself's IDE, and copy all the resouce code *.cpp & *.h to your project.  In general, it is no problem.
